            <img src="./beach.jpeg" class="beach-img" alt="beach-picture">
            <p>Hey there! I am persuing engineering in Computer Science from BMSCE, Bangalore.
                I like exploring different fields and have worked on projects from various domains like
                Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Web Development, Android Application Development and IOT. When I am not
                coding or studing, you'll find me doodling, painting ,playing outdoor or exploring places to eat ;)</p>

                        <p>It’s a big wide world out there.

                            A world of cultural charms and natural wonders; of mega-cities and remote outposts; of paths
                            to
                            cross and lessons to learn; of limitless kindness and harsh realities.

                            We travel to enquire, to hear stories and to be awestruck by incredible scenery. To witness
                            the
                            ingenuity and defiance of individuals and the remarkable output of their cooperation. To be
                            humbled by the history of yesterday, informed about the politics of today and excited by the
                            possibilities of tomorrow.

                            We travel to have fun.

                            Anywhere We Roam is the story of our travels. The moments that moved us, the characters we
                            encountered and the stage upon which it is all set.

                            It’s a big wide world out there, come see it with us.
